# Employee Mangement System

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Taks

I found this assignment to challnege me a bit more but with that challeneg i found the comfort in the confidence within my self to accomplish it. I was able to succesfully link it to MYSQL workbench as well as use my code to input information to the different tables such as the departments , roles, as well as employes, and on a deeper level i was able to code the posibility of viewing the date that was input from the user throught the prompted question in the table format as requested.

## challenges
the challenegs i faced was being able to takle the deleting of a the different inputs, was afraid i was going to delete the entire table.
